## Features

- üéÆ Full Shogi game implementation with all rules
- ü§ñ AI opponent with 4 difficulty levels
- üîç Mate search up to 7 moves
- ‚è±Ô∏è Multiple time control systems
- üåê WebRTC peer-to-peer multiplayer (experimental)
- üì± Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Architecture

### State Management
- **Zustand** for global game state
- **React hooks** for component-level state
- **WebWorkers** for AI processing

### Key Components
- `Board.tsx` - Main game board with piece rendering
- `GameInfo.tsx` - Game status, controls, and information
- `CapturedPieces.tsx` - Display of captured pieces (hands)
- `OnlineGame.tsx` - WebRTC multiplayer interface

### AI Engine
Located in `src/services/ai/`:
- `engine.ts` - Main AI interface and game logic
- `evaluation.ts` - Advanced position evaluation
- `search.ts` - Iterative deepening with alpha-beta pruning

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v24.x (managed by Volta)
- npm v11.x

### Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test           # Run all tests
npm test:watch     # Run tests in watch mode
npm run coverage   # Generate coverage report
```

### Building
```bash
npm run build      # Production build
npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

## AI Implementation

### Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner**: 2-ply search, 1 second thinking time
